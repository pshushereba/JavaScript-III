/* The four principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Global binding: When we're in the global scope, the 'this' keyword will point towards the browser window object.
* 2. Implicit binding: In this context, whenever we call a function using dot notation, the 'this' keyword will refer to the object that is to the left of the dot.
* 3. New binding: When we use the 'new' keyword, it is because we are using a constructor function to instantiate a new Object. In this circumstance, 'this' refers to the specific instance of the object being created.
* 4. 
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
